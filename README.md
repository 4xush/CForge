## Architecture & Security Highlights

### Backend Architecture

The backend architecture follows an MVC-like pattern with a strong focus on separation of concerns. Recent enhancements have significantly bolstered its capabilities:

- **Security**: Includes JWT authentication, password hashing, message encryption, CORS, Helmet, and comprehensive multi-tier rate limiting and brute force protection. Input sanitization practices are in place.
- **Performance**: Leverages Redis for intelligent caching, `p-limit` for managing concurrency in external API calls and database operations, and batch processing for bulk tasks.
- **Reliability**: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for transient API failures, graceful degradation if Redis or cache is unavailable, and robust error handling.
- **Scalability**: The design is job-queue ready (e.g., BullMQ) for handling background tasks and supports horizontal scaling.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend architecture emphasizes component reusability, responsive design, and progressive enhancement:

- **PWA Implementation**: Service worker registration with workbox for advanced caching strategies, providing offline capability and app-like experience.
- **Notification System**: Dual-path implementation for notifications that works in both standard browser and PWA contexts, using service worker registration for PWA environments.
- **Context Management**: Custom hooks with React Context API for efficient state management across the application.
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and optimized asset delivery for faster initial page loads and improved UX.
- **Offline Support**: Strategic caching of assets and previously visited content for limited offline functionality, with clear online/offline status indicators.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API and Performance Issues

- **Rate Limit Errors (429 Too Many Requests)**: Check client-side request frequency or adjust rate limit ENV variables if necessary.
- **Cache Issues**: Use `DELETE /api/users/platform/cache` to invalidate cache. Check Redis connectivity if issues persist.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Utilize `GET /api/health/detailed` and `GET /api/users/platform/stats` for insights.
- **Logs**: Detailed logs are available in `backend/logs/` (e.g., `platform-controller-combined.log`, `redis-combined.log`).

### PWA and Notification Issues

- **PWA Installation Problems**: Clear site data and reinstall the PWA. Ensure the device supports PWA features.
- **Notification Not Working**: For PWA users, notification permissions must be granted and service workers must be active. Check browser settings if notifications don't appear.
- **Offline Content Not Available**: The app caches previously visited pages and data. Content not previously loaded won't be available offline.
- **Service Worker Updates**: If new features aren't appearing, try closing all tabs of the app and reopening to allow service worker updates.
- **Mobile-Specific Issues**: For iOS users, PWA notifications have limitations due to platform restrictions.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Setup

1. Build the application

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Configure production environment

   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGODB_URI=your_production_mongodb_uri
   REDIS_URL=your_production_redis_url
   ```

3. Start the server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### PWA Configuration for Production

1. Ensure proper PWA manifest settings in `vite.config.js`:

   ```javascript
   VitePWA({
     registerType: "autoUpdate",
     manifest: {
       name: "CForge",
       short_name: "CForge",
       theme_color: "#6b46c1",
       icons: [
         // Icon configurations
       ],
       // Other PWA settings
     },
     workbox: {
       // Caching strategies
       navigateFallback: "/index.html",
       // Workbox configurations
     },
   });
   ```

2. Configure Service Worker for Push Notifications:

   - Ensure `sw-push.js` is properly set up for notification handling
   - Test notification delivery across browsers and devices
   - Implement proper error handling for different environments

3. Test PWA Installation Flow:
   - Verify install prompts appear on supported devices
   - Test home screen launch behavior
   - Validate offline functionality works as expected

### Health Monitoring

- `/api/health`: Basic health check
- `/api/health/detailed`: Detailed system status
- `/api/health/cache`: Cache system status
- `/api/health/redis`: Redis connection status
- `/api/health/services`: Check all microservices status
