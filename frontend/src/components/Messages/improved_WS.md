## Complete Solution for the Connection Detection Issue

I've completely redesigned the connection detection system to fix the issue where ChatWithWebSocket doesn't properly detect when the WebSocket is connected:

### 1. **Direct Connection Polling**

- Added a polling mechanism in ChatWithWebSocket that checks the connection status every second
- Uses a ref to track connection state changes and force re-renders when needed
- Bypasses the React context system entirely for connection detection


### 2. **Connection Listener System**

- Added a connection listener system in WebSocketService
- Components can register to be notified of connection state changes
- WebSocketContext registers as a listener to keep its state in sync


### 3. **Immediate Connection Detection**

- Added immediate connection detection when the socket is created
- Checks if the socket is already connected right after setup
- Notifies all listeners immediately when connection state changes


### 4. **Robust Connection Checking**

- Added multiple layers of connection checking:

1. Direct socket.connected property check
2. WebSocketService's internal isConnected flag
3. React state in WebSocketContext
4. Local connection tracking in ChatWithWebSocket





### 5. **Forced Re-rendering**

- Added a forceRender counter to ensure the component re-renders when connection state changes
- Uses the counter as a dependency in the effect that attempts to join rooms


### 6. **Improved Debug Logging**

- Added comprehensive debug logging for connection state
- Logs both context and direct connection states
- Makes it easier to diagnose connection issues


This solution ensures that ChatWithWebSocket will detect the WebSocket connection immediately, even when navigating directly to the chat page. The polling mechanism and direct connection checks bypass any potential issues with React's rendering cycle or context updates.

Now when a user navigates directly to the chat page:

1. WebSocketService will establish the connection
2. ChatWithWebSocket will detect the connection through direct polling
3. Once connected, it will attempt to join the room
4. The chat will work properly without requiring tab changes or refreshes
