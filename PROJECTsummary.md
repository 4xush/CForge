# CForge: Coding Community Platform with Progress Analytics

**Bridging the Gap Between Individual Progress and Peer Learning**

## üöÄ Project Overview

**CForge** is a coding community platform with progress analytics designed to solve a fundamental problem in the coding community: the disconnect between individual progress on coding platforms and peer awareness. While many students actively solve problems on LeetCode, GitHub, and Codeforces, their efforts often remain invisible to their peers, creating missed opportunities for motivation, collaboration, and mentorship.

### The Problem

- **Isolated Progress**: Students work in silos across different platforms
- **Lack of Visibility**: Peer achievements go unnoticed
- **Missing Motivation**: No community-driven encouragement
- **Limited Collaboration**: Difficulty finding study partners or mentors
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Progress scattered across multiple platforms

### The Solution

CForge creates a unified ecosystem where coders can track, collaborate, compete, and grow together through shared visibility and community engagement.

- Users create topic-specific or general coding rooms
- Invite-based or open joining mechanisms
- Room categorization (competitive programming, web development, etc.)

#### Real-time Leaderboards

- **Platform-based Filtering**:
  - LeetCode: Total problems, contest rating, streak count
  - Codeforces: Current rating, contest participation, problem count
  - GitHub: Contribution streaks, repository metrics (upcoming)
- **Dynamic Sorting**: Multiple filter criteria for comprehensive ranking
- **Auto-refresh**: Regular updates via backend cron jobs

#### Interactive Room Chat

- **Public Discussion Forum**: Open communication for all room members
- **Use Cases**:
  - Problem-solving discussions
  - Hackathon coordination
  - Study group planning
  - Doubt clarification
  - Resource sharing

### 3. Contest Tracking System

**Never Miss an Opportunity**

- **Multi-platform Contest Aggregation**:
  - LeetCode weekly/biweekly contests
  - Codeforces rounds and educational contests
- **Timeline View**: Ongoing and upcoming contests
- **Notification System**: Contest reminders (in development)

### 4. Peer Benchmarking & Mentorship

**Growth Through Community**

- **Performance Comparison**: See where you stand among peers
- **Mentorship Facilitation**: Connect with higher-ranked members
- **Skill Gap Identification**: Understand areas for improvement
- **Collaborative Learning**: Group problem-solving sessions

## üìä Example Use Case Scenario

### **"The Computer Science Study Group"**

**Background**: A group of 15 computer science students wants to improve their competitive programming skills together.

**Implementation**:

1. **Room Creation**: One student creates "CS Cohort 2024 - Competitive Programming"
2. **Member Onboarding**: All 15 students join and link their LeetCode and Codeforces profiles
3. **Progress Tracking**: The unified dashboard shows each member's:
   - LeetCode: 450 problems solved, 1800 contest rating
   - Codeforces: 1650 rating, 45 contests participated
4. **Weekly Competition**: Room leaderboard sorted by "problems solved this week"
5. **Collaboration**:
   - Top performer shares dynamic programming resources in chat
   - Struggling member asks for help with graph algorithms
   - Group coordinates participation in upcoming Codeforces Educational Round
6. **Mentorship**: Higher-rated member offers 1-on-1 problem-solving sessions

**Results**:

- **Increased Motivation**: Visible progress encourages consistent practice
- **Peer Learning**: Knowledge sharing accelerates skill development
- **Contest Participation**: Group coordination leads to higher participation rates
- **Community Building**: Strong bonds formed through shared challenges

## üîÑ Data Flow & System Integration

### User Onboarding Process

1. **Account Creation**: User registers with email/password
2. **Profile Linking**: Connects LeetCode, Codeforces, GitHub accounts
3. **Data Synchronization**: Backend fetches initial platform data
4. **Dashboard Generation**: Unified view created with analytics

### Real-time Updates

1. **Scheduled Jobs**: Cron jobs fetch fresh data every 6 hours
2. **Cache Management**: Redis stores frequently accessed leaderboard data
3. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time chat updates in rooms
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Efficient platform API usage to avoid throttling
